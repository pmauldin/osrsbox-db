    "description": "If you're new to Shilo Village after solving the mystery (or even if you did it some time ago), you may like to check out Yanni Salika's antiques shop.\n\nHe's a busy chap, revamping antique items, checking out new stock from potential adventurers and maybe he'll have a small<sup>(1)</sup> favour to ask of you? Probably nothing particularly large, Yanni isn't a demanding<sup>(2)</sup> person, should hardly take you any time<sup>(3)</sup> at all really, something to do when you have a spare moment.\n\nThat's assuming there aren't any complications.\n\n1: - Perception of the word \"small\" may be open to interpretation.\n\n2: - In a recent vote, Yanni Salika was only voted the second most demanding person in Shilo Village.\n\n3: - As everyone knows, time is relative.",
